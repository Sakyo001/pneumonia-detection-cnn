## Integration with Scoring System

### Backend Integration (Already Implemented)
The form now collects all required data for:
- `detectCovidRisk(symptomData)` - Returns COVID risk level and score
- `detectTBRisk(symptomData)` - Returns TB risk level and score
- `generateCrossValidationAlert()` - Returns clinical alerts

These functions are available in `symptom-scoring.ts` and can be integrated into the upload action.

### Risk Detection Thresholds

**COVID-19:**
- HIGH: â‰¥30 points (e.g., loss of taste/smell alone)
- MODERATE: 20-29 points
- LOW: <20 points

**Tuberculosis:**
- HIGH: â‰¥50 points (e.g., hemoptysis + night sweats)
- MODERATE: 30-49 points
- LOW: <30 points

## User Experience Flow

1. **Doctor opens Upload X-ray page**
2. **Fills basic patient information**
3. **Expands symptom sections as needed:**
   - Primary Symptoms
   - Vital Signs
   - Cough Characteristics
   - Symptom Onset & Duration
   - Associated Symptoms
   - Risk Factors
   - **COVID-19 Specific** (if suspected)
   - **TB Specific** (if suspected)
4. **Submits form with X-ray**
5. **System analyzes:**
   - X-ray image â†’ Model prediction
   - Symptoms â†’ Confidence adjustment
   - COVID/TB signatures â†’ Cross-validation alerts
6. **Results display with enhanced confidence and alerts**

## Testing Checklist

### COVID-19 Testing
- [ ] Check "Loss of Taste or Smell" â†’ Should trigger HIGH COVID risk
- [ ] Verify yellow warning background displays correctly
- [ ] Confirm section is collapsible and closed by default
- [ ] Test with known exposure only â†’ Should be MODERATE risk
- [ ] Verify checkbox state persists when section toggled

### TB Testing
- [ ] Check "Night Sweats" + "Hemoptysis" â†’ Should trigger HIGH TB risk (50+ points)
- [ ] Verify red critical background displays correctly
- [ ] Enter cough duration (e.g., 8 weeks) â†’ Should add 40 points to score
- [ ] Test all 8 TB indicators â†’ Should exceed 100 points
- [ ] Verify number input accepts valid numbers only

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Submit form with COVID symptoms â†’ Verify symptoms passed to backend
- [ ] Submit form with TB symptoms â†’ Verify symptoms passed to backend
- [ ] Check TypeScript compilation â†’ No errors
- [ ] Test responsive layout on mobile â†’ Yellow/red sections display correctly
- [ ] Verify form state resets after successful submission

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Integrate Cross-Validation in actions.ts
```typescript
import { detectCovidRisk, detectTBRisk, generateCrossValidationAlert } from './symptom-scoring';

// In uploadXray function, after ML prediction:
const covidRisk = detectCovidRisk(symptomData);
const tbRisk = detectTBRisk(symptomData);

const alerts = generateCrossValidationAlert({
  xrayPrediction: prediction.class,
  covidRisk: covidRisk.riskLevel,
  tbRisk: tbRisk.riskLevel,
  confidenceScore: adjustedConfidence
});

// Include alerts in response
return {
  ...result,
  crossValidationAlerts: alerts
};
```

### 2. Display Alerts in UI
Update `AnalysisResultDisplay` component to show:
- INFO alerts (blue badge)
- WARNING alerts (yellow badge with icon)
- CRITICAL alerts (red badge with urgent icon)

### 3. Add Automatic Testing Recommendations
Based on risk levels, automatically suggest:
- COVID: PCR test, rapid antigen test
- TB: Sputum AFB, GeneXpert, respiratory isolation

## Technical Details

**TypeScript Interfaces:**
- All fields properly typed in `SymptomData` interface
- Optional fields use `?: boolean` or `| undefined`
- Number fields properly typed as `number | undefined`

**State Management:**
- Checkbox fields: `updateSymptom(field, boolean)`
- Number fields: `updateSymptom(field, number | undefined)`
- Section toggles: Independent state for each section

**Styling:**
- Yellow sections: `bg-yellow-50 border-yellow-300`
- Red sections: `bg-red-50 border-red-300`
- Consistent with premium white + indigo-purple gradient theme
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns desktop)

## Validation Rules

**COVID-19:**
- At least one COVID-specific symptom â†’ Recommend PCR testing
- Loss of taste/smell alone â†’ HIGH risk, immediate testing
- Multiple indicators â†’ Increase confidence, flag for isolation

**TB:**
- Chronic cough >3 weeks â†’ Investigate further
- Hemoptysis (any amount) â†’ CRITICAL, immediate workup
- Night sweats + weight loss + chronic cough â†’ HIGH TB risk
- Multiple indicators + risk factors â†’ Respiratory isolation protocol
